    "    \"Arjun had stopped keeping track of time. Days blurred into nights, and nights into days. His small one-room flat in North Kolkata felt like a prison of memories. The fan creaked above him, swaying as if it too had grown tired of life. He hadn‚Äôt been to work in weeks; friends no longer called. The city outside, bustling as ever, seemed distant, unreal. His mother‚Äôs last letter lay on the table, folded neatly, now stained with tea. He never opened it. He couldn‚Äôt. Loneliness gnawed at him, yet a dull, empty routine had become comfort. Fleeting nostalgia reminded him of street music, laughter, and small joys lost to time.\",\n",
    "    \"One evening, half drunk and half asleep, Arjun rummaged through dusty DVDs. His hand froze over 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne', a childhood favorite. Something stirred inside him, a spark he thought lost.The familiar music filled the room.\",\n",
    "    \"The Bhooter Raja appeared on screen, swaying, voice both funny and frightening. Three boons: food, travel, music. Arjun whispered bitterly, 'If only someone gave me those three boons‚Ä¶' The words lingered as the film ended.\",\n",
    "    \"That night, shadows twisted unnaturally. The fan‚Äôs creak sounded less like a groan, more like a laugh. Then‚Äîa whisper: 'Do you really want them?'\\nArjun froze. Darkness coalesced into a tall figure with a crown of bones, eyes glowing faintly. 'Bho‚Ä¶ Bhooter Raja?' he stammered.\\n\\nThe figure smiled, unnaturally wide. 'You called me, didn‚Äôt you?' Fear gripped him.\\n\\nArjun‚Äôs heart pounded. 'I‚Ä¶ I want them,' he said. 'The three boons. Just like Goopy and Bagha.'\\n\\nThe Bhooter Raja leaned close. 'Are you sure?'\\n\\nArjun nodded, desperate. 'Yes. Give them to me.'\\n\\nSilence fell. Air thickened. Then the Raja whispered: 'So be it.' And vanished. Only the scent of damp earth remained.\",\n",
    "    \"He tested the first boon. Wishing for biryani, a steaming plate appeared before him, aromas rich and inviting. Each bite felt like heaven, but soon his appetite became insatiable.\",\n",
    "    \"Travel came next: he wished for Darjeeling, instantly feeling the chill of mountain air, mist clinging to his face. Streets were silent, eerie, yet beautiful.\\n\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Excited, he opened a YouTube channel. His first song received one million views overnight. Subscribers exploded. Fans adored him. He became a sensation.\",\n",
    "    \"Interviews, fan messages, and public appearances filled his days. Initially, he responded to fans, humble and grateful. He felt alive, powerful, adored. He reveled in praise, each view and comment inflating his pride. Even small compliments felt like treasures.\\n\\nThe world seemed to obey him. Music flowed effortlessly. The feeling was intoxicating. He started imagining bigger dreams, larger stages, more recognition. For a while, life felt perfect, magical, unstoppable.\",\n",
    "    \"Arrogance crept into every gesture. Trolls mocked his weight, his appearance, his attitude. Each criticism made him lash out. He binged on food night after night, trying to fill the emptiness inside. But the endless feasting came with a cost‚Äîhis body grew heavy, bloated, sickly. He hated what he saw in the mirror: pale skin stretched over swollen features, cheeks puffed, eyes dull. The man he once admired in reflections was gone, replaced by someone grotesque, helpless, and trapped in his own indulgence.\\n\\nFilm offers were withdrawn. Friends avoided him. Even fame felt hollow. Helplessness wrapped around him like a heavy blanket. He realized he had been a prisoner of his own desires, and the boons offered only temporary illusions.\",\n",
    "    \"In despair, Arjun wished to see his first love Tulika,the only person who had stood by him. He appeared at her house, heart pounding. Laughter echoed; she was with another man, declaring she hated him and that he was good for nothing. The scene shattered him completely.\\n\\nCollapsing to the ground, he felt the full weight of isolation, failure, and the consequences of unchecked desire.\",\n",
    "    \"He called the Bhooter Raja. 'Take back the boons! I want my old life!' he pleaded.\\n\\nThe ghost king appeared, towering, laughter echoing. 'Now you understand‚Äîtalents are gifts, but must be nurtured. Left unchecked, they rot. You cannot expect the world to bend to your will.\",\n",
    "    \"'\\n\\nShadows receded. Magic, fame, endless food‚Äîgone. On the table lay a simple envelope. Arjun opened it: a small music company had seen him perform at a local show and invited him to audition. He realized, Raw talent,untouched by boons‚Äîwas enough.\",\n",
    "    \"For the first time in months, he smiled. No magic, no fame, no endless food. Only his talent, his determination, and the small chance to rebuild. He understood now: life‚Äôs true boons are the ones you cultivate yourself. Effort, care, persistence‚Äîthese are what create real magic.\\n\\nThe Bhooter Raja‚Äôs laughter lingered faintly, a subtle reminder of temptation, but Arjun felt ready to face the world anew.\"\n",
