The Descent
They walked toward the back, looking for a cashier, when Kabir noticed a sign:
“More items downstairs →”
A narrow staircase led downward, lit by a single dangling bulb.
“Maybe the office is down there?” Riya suggested.
The steps creaked under their feet. The air smelled of something damp and metallic.
They reached the bottom—
—only to find another sign:
“More items downstairs →”
Another staircase. Same dim bulb. Same creaking steps.
“Wait,” Mehul said, frowning, “We just… came down. How is there another one?”
They climbed back up—
—but when they reached the “top,” it wasn’t the supermarket floor.
It was another identical staircase… leading further down.
The walls seemed closer. The air, heavier.
They tried running up, running down, skipping steps, even counting—but the count never ended.
Every landing led to the same staircase, the same buzzing bulb, the same damp smell.
