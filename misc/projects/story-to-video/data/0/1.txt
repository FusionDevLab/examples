The Arrival
It was past 8:00 PM when Riya, Kabir, and Mehul entered the silent city of Bansipur.
A faint mist curled along the cracked roads, the streetlamps flickering as if unsure they wanted to stay lit.
They had been driving for hours, lost after taking a wrong turn from the highway. Fuel gauge—dangerously low.
Bansipur looked deserted, except for one building at the end of the main road:
a bright, glowing sign that read “Mehta Super Mart – Always Open.”
Riya gave a nervous laugh.
“Creepy or not, we need snacks. And water. And… maybe a map.”
They parked, the sound of their car engine echoing too loudly in the empty street.
The sliding doors of the supermarket opened with a slow hiss, though no one stood behind the counter.
Inside, the air was too cold for summer.
The lights buzzed overhead, but the aisles were perfectly stocked—cereal boxes lined like soldiers, canned goods gleaming, fruits unnaturally shiny.
Mehul called out, “Hello? Anyone here?”
Only the sound of the automatic doors sighing shut behind them replied.
