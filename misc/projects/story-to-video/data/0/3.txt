The Last Step
Hours—or maybe minutes—passed.
Their phones had no signal. Batteries drained faster than they should.
Riya’s water bottle slipped from her hand and rolled down… endlessly. They never heard it hit the bottom.
Kabir began muttering, “We’re not supposed to be here… We weren’t supposed to see this.”
Then they noticed something new—
On the wall, near the bulb, a smear. Dark red.
The smear grew fresher, dripping.
From above, faint footsteps echoed—slow, deliberate.
But when they looked up, the staircase was empty.
The lights began to flicker, and in one brief flash, Riya saw them—
Three figures. Pale. Wide-eyed. Standing on the stairs just a few steps above.
They looked exactly like Riya, Kabir, and Mehul—
—but their faces were twisted, rotting, their eyes black pits.
The next flicker of light went out completely.
In the darkness, the footsteps came closer.
The last thing anyone heard was the supermarket doors hissing open upstairs…
…with no one coming out.
